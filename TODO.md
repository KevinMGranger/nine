# TODO

In decreasing order of importance:

- [x] simplify strings
- [x] switch to thiserror to simplify error handling (stopgap for custom)
- [ ] figure out how/if to do datetime stuff
- [x] ~~switch away from error handling libs in favor of a custom implementation
    (or reconsider. is reimplimenting thiserrror worth it for the sake of fewer deps?)~~
    yeah, just sticking with thiserror
  

Undecided importance:

- [ ] add types for 9p2000.u
- [ ] add types for 9p2000.l
- [ ] find a way to test example in README?
- [ ] show reading a response in README?
- [ ] do the tagged/core idea from [IDEAS](IDEAS.md)?
